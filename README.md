# CG-InClassActivity2

Implementing the shaders was easy as the code was available on canvas. It was fun to tweak the inspector values and see how it affects the shaders. A weakness was getting certain things to work, like the metallic effect and transparency on the wall, as it would only work sometimes, but that was an issue with unity. I didnâ€™t experience difficulties actually using the shaders outside of the unity issues, as I have some understanding of how the code works and what the inspector values do. 

I did alpha blending, decals that can be toggled, a moving hologram, transparent billboard texture, specular PBR, standard PBR, and an x-ray stencil shader effect.
